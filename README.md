To build jlox, you'll need Maven installed on your machine. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jlox.git
    cd jlox
    ```

2. Build the project using Maven:

    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

    This will compile the source code, run tests, and package the project.
